It would be really cool if you could create a translation of Gnome-
Pie into your language!

It is quite easy and involves the following steps. All you need is the 
locale string for your language. You can get it with the terminal
command "echo $LANG".

CREATING A NEW TRANSLATION

1. Update the gnomepie.pot file
	* navigate with a terminal to the directory "resources/locale"
	* enter the command "./gen-pot.sh"
2. Create your translation file
	* enter the command "./gen-po.sh"
	* follow instructions
3. Translate to your language
	* open the file "resources/locale/[your locale]/LC_MESSAGES/[your locale].po"
	* create translations for every string in this file (write it after each "msgstr")
4. Compile translations
	* enter the command "./compile-po.sh"
	  
	  
UPDATING AN EXISTENT TRANSLATION

1. Update the gnomepie.pot file
	* navigate with a terminal to the directory "resources/locale"
	* enter the command "./gen-pot.sh"
2. Update your translation file
	* enter the command "./update-po.sh"
	* follow instructions
3. Translate to your language
	* open the file "/resources/locale/[your locale]/LC_MESSAGES/[your locale].po"
	* create translations for every string in this file which don't have translations already
4. Compile translations
	* enter the command "./compile-po.sh"
